1. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4023) Generic Objects [should](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System) be supported but does not work (e.g. `Object<string, number>`)
  ```js
  /**
   * @type {Object<string>}
    */
    const x = {
      hello: 555, // This should raise error, but does not
    }
    
    /**
     * @type {Object<string,number>}
     */
    const x = {
      hello: 1,
      name: "Jhon" // This should raise error, but does not
    }
  ```
  passes without error
2. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4024) `typeof` operator [should](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System) be supported but does not work
  ```js
    const x = {
    name: "Bat",
    surname: "Man"
  }

  /**
   * @type {typeof x} // This raises error but should not
   */
  const y = {
    name: "Cat",
    surname: "Woman"
  }
  ```
  ```
    ./src/js/index.js:10:12: WARNING - [JSC_TYPE_MISMATCH] initializing variable
    found   : {name: string, surname: string}
    required: {name: string, surname: string}
      10|   const y = {
                      ^
      11|     name: "Cat",
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      12|     surname: "Woman"
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      13|   }
          ^^^
  ```
3. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4025) `all` type [should not](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System#the-javascript-type-language) allow access of its properties, but in fact it does without any warning/error.
    ```js
    /**
    * @type {*}
    */
    const x = 1
    /**
    * @type {number}
    */
    const y = x.toString() // This should raise error but does not
    ```

    Doc seems to be written with the assumption that `strictCheckTypes` `strictMissingProperties` is used.
4. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4026) Arrays are assumed to never be empty, aka GCC does not warn that value at index might be undefined
  ```js
    /**
     * @type {Array<number>}
    */
    const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    /**
    * @type {number}
    */
    const x = values[1000] // This should raise error. x is obviously undefined, but its type is number
  ```
5. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4027) HTMLCollection access is wrongly assumed to never be undefined
  ```js
    /**
    * @type {!Element}
    */
    const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0] // here should be a warning that value is potentially undefined
  ```
1. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4029) GC wrongly assumes that `Map.get()` always returns a defined value
  ```js
  /**
   * @type {Map<string, number>}
   */
  const map = new Map()

  map.set('john', 1)

  /**
   * @type {number}
   */
  const value = map.get('jack') // should produce error, value is obviously undefined but GC thinks it is number
  ```
8. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4030) Interfaces do not check return type of method when you do not call `return`
  ```js
    /** @interface */
    function ISerializable() {};
    /** @type {function(): string} */
    ISerializable.prototype.serialize;

    /**
     * @implements {ISerializable}
    * @constructor
    */
    function Car() {}
    Car.prototype.serialize = function() {}; // Does not produce error, even though it should return a string and it most definitely does not 
  ```
9. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4031) Typedefs (or *record types*) do not support recursion but instead of error, the recursive attribute just gets converted to `any` type.
  ```js
    /**
     * @typedef {{ name: string, next: Car }} // should produce error, but instead it treats `.next` as `?`
     */
    var Car;

    /**
     * @type {Car}
     */
    const car = {
      name: 'BMW',
      next: {
        name: 'Audi',
      }
    }
  ```
10. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4032) Union types must be in brackets, otherwise GCC fails to recognize it
  ```js
      /**
       * @type {{
      *  name: (string|undefined),
      *  age: number|undefined, // Produces error below
      * }}
      */
      const person = {}

      // ./src/js/index.js:4:14: WARNING - [JSC_TYPE_PARSE_ERROR] Bad type annotation. expected closing } See https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler for more information.
      //   4| *  age: number|undefined,
      //                    ^
  ```
11. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4033) It is impossible to define empty record type
  ```js
    /**
     * @type {{}} // produces error.
    */
    const x = {}
  ``` 
  ({} type would be useful, because code developes over time, let's say you have a function with options, but you don't know what options yet)

  the closest you can get is
  ```js
    /**
     * @type {{_: undefined}}
    */
    const x = {}
  ```
12. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4034) `typeof` params are not type checked
```js
const x = _data.somethingMadeUp  // produces error
const y = typeof _data.somethingMadeUp // ok
```
13. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4035) Documentation on Window type is missing. It should be here https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System. The same goes for NodeList of Element
14. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4037) suppressing errors is very difficult because error JSC_STRICT_INEXISTENT_PROPERTY, why do I have to go to suppression list, why does not the CLI tell me the supression group immediately?
https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/@suppress-annotations
15. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4037) There should be a way to suppress all warnings on a line or in one file (like //@ts-ignore and //@ts-nocheck) it is useful
16. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4038) Everything from [./compiler/cli-issues](./compiler/cli-issues)
17. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4039) Lacking documentation of modern ES6 syntax with interface and implements
18. @export is [deprecated or best avoided](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/externs-and-exports). This should be also mentioned in the wiki, e.g. [here](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler#export-export-sometyp)
19. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4040) Type checking of promises does not work
20. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4042) Object rest operator does not get type checked correctly.
21. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4043) Configuring source maps is a pain
22. [ISSUE](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/312) Array literals go not get type checked
23. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4044) Array.reduce() is not type checked
24. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4047) Array `pop` and `shift` are badly typed (never undefined)
25. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4048) goog.provide needs base.js
26. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4049) goog.module needs base.js
27. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4051) undocumented ES2021, ES2022 features
28. [REPORTED](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4053) some compiler flags are a mess
    1. compilation_level - what is bundle? rest can be googled. link to explanation
    2. env - CUSTOM means what?
    3. externs - should be deprecated
    4. warning_level - the default is default ... what does that mean?
    5. --process_common_js_modules should be on by default, unless it is experimental, in which case it should be marked as experimental
    6. module_resolution - what is BROWSER_WITH_TRANSFORMED_PREFIXES? what is the difference between node and webpack. why I must use NODE in order to be able to import from node_modules? or it should be mentioned that i need to do that.
    7.  force_inject_library - base means Google closure base.js? it is not obvious
    8.  source_map_input,source_map_location_mapping - what is the difference between em
    9.  third_party - what style rules?
    10. js - not javascript filename but javascript input file(s), explain how glob works, don't just say minimatch. Explain that node_modules have to be included as well


# TODO to report
Extra
 5. dependency_mode PRUNE does not work for node_modules, If I don't use any code from a node module it still gets parsed and `validated` by GCC and if it is invalid, it kills the whole compilation. This is the reason why node_modules/**.js just does not work as a simple way to do build script
6. TODO about CJS https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3714


## Already reported issues
1. `!Type` behavior should be configurable - https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/641
