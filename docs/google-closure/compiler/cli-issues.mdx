# GCC issues
GCC CLI has a lot of flags, sometimes it is a challenge to understand what they do.

## Generic issues
1. There is not guide to walk me through main topics - minification, transpilation, working with libs.
2. ‚ùå I have to use a LOT of flags, but there is no config file (like webpack.config.js)
3. There is no plugin system, so missing features will not be added by the community.
4. Creation of source maps is needlessly complicated and it is not explained anywhere [github issue](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/218) 
5. GCC errors in stdout are white, some color would be nice (orange/red).
6. There is no watch mode.

## GCC CLI issues
Some CLI flags are obscure, some wrongly documented. I went through all of them, let's break it down.

1. `compilation_level`, `externs`, `conformance_configs`, `extra_annotation_name`, 
2. `js` - does not say anything about node_modules
3. `warning_level` - warnings about what?
4. `debug` - does not seem to be doing anything
5. `generate_exports` vs `export_local_property_definitions` - what is the difference?
6. "Available Error Groups" - should link to here https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Warnings
7. `--js_module_root` - wrong doc (https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3628)
8. `module_resolution` - `BROWSER_WITH_TRANSFORMED_PREFIXES` undocumented
9.  `--process_common_js_modules` wrong doc
10. `chunk` wrong doc
11. `source_map_input` - this is for libraries?
12. `source_map_location_mapping` - insufficient doc
13. `browser_featureset_year` - what does it do exactly?
14. `charset` should be charset_input and charset_output
15. `--js` flag should not be necessary but is, the engine creates a dependency tree anyway
