# Compiler
The compiler (GCC) does type checking, tree shaking, minification and a implements support for module systems. Nothing however comes out-of-the-box, and [working with GCC CLI is a real pain](./cli-issues).

Do you want source maps? Yes, possible but I won't tell you how. Do you want minification/optimization? Yes, that is what GCC is famous for but you have to figure out how on your own. Do you want to import code from `node_modules`? Go look on stackoverflow to figure out how, and even then it will not work.

The most basic setup, just to compile a bundle is pretty complex:

```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --entry_point=./src/js/index.js \
  --js=./src/**.js \ # This glob must select all JS files that should (potentially) be in the bundle
  --js_output_file=./dist/bundle.js
```

All in all GCC seems good at compiling simple web app without dependencies but anything beyond that is a headache.

## Module systems
CJS and ESM syntax are supported out-of-the-box. [GC also comes with its own `goog.provide()`, `goog.require()` modules system, which is a terrible mess](./closure-modules).

One weird quirk is that you have to configure

```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --module_resolution=WEBPACK
```

this allows you to write imports without file extension.

```js
import { app } from './app' // not app.js
```

[Module systems can interop.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/ES6-modules-and-Closure-interop)


## Using libraries
Using libraries is a headache. [Read all about using libraries here.](./using-libraries)

## Type checking
In order to run strict type checking configure:
```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --warning_level=VERBOSE \
  --jscomp_error=checkDebuggerStatement \
  --jscomp_error=unusedLocalVariables \
  --jscomp_error=reportUnknownTypes \
  --jscomp_error=strictCheckTypes;
```
You can read more about [warnings configuration here](../types/warnings-config).

If you want only vague/optional type checking, configure:
```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --warning_level=VERBOSE;
```

## Tree shaking
In order to enable tree-shaking configure:

```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --entry_point=./src/js/index.js \
  --dependency_mode=PRUNE \
  --output_manifest=./dist/structure.txt # This file will contain a list of all files that have been used to compile the bundle (for debug purposes)
```

## Code minification / optimization
Optimizations should provide code minification, even dead code elimination and some other optimizations.

In order to run optimizations configure:

```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --entry_point=./src/js/index.js \
  --dependency_mode=PRUNE \ # The first optimization is to enable tree shaking here
  --assume_function_wrapper=true \ # Allow more optimizations because I'm not using Window. For me this gave me (cca 50% bundle size reduction) in Fractals project. Finally GCC was able to minify all by variables
  --compilation_level=ADVANCED # Ultra minification and optimizations
```

Limitations of **advanced** optimization:

1. You cannot use `getter/setters`
2. You cannot mix `obj.name` and `obj['name']` property access styles

Less scary limitations:

1. You cannot use `Object.defineProperties`
2. You can use `this` only in prototype methods

1. https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/limitations
2. https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3

## Source maps
Source maps are a very useful tool during development. Without it there is no debugging. With GCC this is ridiculously hard to set up. ([reported](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4043))

```bash
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --create_source_map=%outname%.map \
  --source_map_include_content=true \ # This includes the source files inside the source map
  --output_wrapper="%output%//# sourceMappingURL=bundle.js.map"
```

## ESNext support
GCC has a pretty good [support of ESNext features](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Supported-features), but it is not on par with modern engines.

‚ùå [public/private class fields are not supported](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/2731), you must define them in constructor instead! This means `arrow methods` are not supported either.

## Transpilation & polyfills
Input language is stable ESNEXT (so currently ES2022). Output language is the same. To transpile to ES5, just use:

```
java -jar ./scripts/closureCompiler.jar \
  --language_out=ECMASCRIPT5;
```

The transpilation also automatically adds polyfills (it adds only the necessary polyfills, nothing extra) - **this works great!** [Read more in the doc.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Polyfills)

<Fail>Here is the list of supported ES features, and it is not complete https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Supported-features (REPORTED)</Fail>

## Cyclic dependencies
When using GC module system (`goog.provide` / `goog.module`) it is not possible to create a cyclic dependency, the compiler immediately raises error. This is great!

<Fail>However for CJS/ESM modules GCC allows cyclic dependencies between files and there is no option to prevent them. This is a ticking time bomb! (Webpack has the same problem, but at least there is a plugin to fix that.)</Fail>

## Compiling web workers
[Using web workers is a pain.](./webworker) The main problems are caused by GCC's aggressive  minification in advanced mode. In a nutshell I have to define **externs** for data sent / received from a web worker.

## Compiling server calls
Due to aggressive minification in advanced mode, [I have to define **externs** for all data sent / received from a server or e.g. from local storage.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/How-do-I-make-closure-compiler-stop-breaking-my-API-by-removing-and-renaming-things%3F#why-is-closure-compiler-breaking-me-by-removing-and-renaming-things)

## Compiler flags
`--debug` flag works only in advanced optimization mode. [It helps you understand why/how things have been renamed!](http://closuretools.blogspot.com/2011/01/property-by-any-other-name-part-1.html)

## Extra
- [**There seems to be support for i18n**](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Translations) - As with anything, I would not rely on it until I prove that it works well.
- [**JS Conformance**](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/JS-Conformance-Framework) - The compiler has a smart feature where it can do more than just type checking, you can configure it to ban any *suspicious* code that you like. (e.g. ban all console logs, empty functions)
- [**ID generators**](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Id-Generator-Annotations) - To create obfuscated HTML IDs. The compiler can generate and ID generator function and inline these IDs at the same time. All you need to do is define a dummy `id()` function and annotate it. I am not sure tho how this can be useful.
- [**Instrumentation**](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Production-instrumentation) - This is actually about how to get **test coverage** statistics. Google closure library provides some testing support. [Here is a random example of some test.](https://github.com/google/closure-library/blob/master/closure/goog/testing/continuationtestcase_test.js)
