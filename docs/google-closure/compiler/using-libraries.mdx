# Using libraries
Libraries are used via externs. Externs may define types, but they most importantly define the libs API and prevent GCC from mangling this code.

GCC works well with window libraries (that are not part of compilation). But trying to use CJS libraries from `node_modules` is a terrible mess that ultimately works only if you are very lucky.

- [advanced notes on externs](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/How-do-I-make-closure-compiler-stop-breaking-my-API-by-removing-and-renaming-things%3F) - good explanation of when externs are needed. It mentions that server calls, web workers need externs. It mentions that externs do not need to be imported (they are global). It shows example of how to do externs for web worker

## Existing extern type definitions
### Built-ins
- Built-in externs for [browser APIs including DOM, Window, fetch API, etc.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/externs/browser)
- Built-in externs for [JS APIs including Math, Number, String, Array, etc.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/externs)
- Built-in externs for [Node.js](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/contrib/nodejs)
- Another externs for [Node.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs), don't know what is the difference compared to built-ins
- Built-in externs for [3rd party libs, such as Google Maps, jQuery, Angular](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/contrib/externs)
### Other
- Other externs for [3rd party libs, such as Firebase, HLS.js, React](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Externs-For-Common-Libraries)



## Using Window, UMD(Window) libs
Don't run it through the compiler, simply include it in a script tag in HTML, old style. The only thing you need to do now is to [define externs as explained here](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/externs-and-exports#externs) to prevent mangling, and that's it.

Example of my micro library: (not part of compilation)
```html
<script>
  window.greet = {
    one: (name) => { console.info('hello' + name) },
    many: () => { console.info('hi all') }
  }
</script>
```

Example of externs file: This file can be anywhere in the directory structure, the only thing you need to do is to pass it to the compiler via `--js` just like any normal JS file.
```js
/**
 * @fileoverview Externs for greet lib @externs
 */
const greet = {};
/**
 * @param {string} name
 */
greet.one = function(name) {};
greet.many = function() {};
```
Example of code:
```js
// Notice there is no import, `greet` namespace/variable is global
greet.one('John')
```
Here is an interesting caveat, even though your `greet` namespace is global and therefore should exist on `window`, GCC type-checking does not allow you to call it via window.

```js
window.greet.many() // raises error
// WARNING - [JSC_INEXISTENT_PROPERTY] Property greet never defined on Window
```

<Todo>report this. At least it should be documented, because this is a nonsense situation. The library is literally defined on window, externs are global, etc window access does not work</Todo>

## Using CJS, UMD(CJS)
[GCC claims to support CJS and UMD modules](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/JS-Modules#commonjs-modules) however it does not work on so many levels that I will have to [dedicate a whole chapter to it](./using-cjs-libraries).
