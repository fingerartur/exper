# GC type inference
Here I will briefly analyze how smart is GCC. Can it infer some types or do I have to declare everything a million times like in the case of Flow?

I will try to compare GC to TS and vscode JS/TS language features with is a syntax checker built-in to the IDE.

## Variable

âœ… GC can infer type of a statically initialized variable (not initialized via a function call.). Except arrays.

```js
const name = 'Artur'
/**
 * @type {number}
 */
const num = name // will error
```

```js
const person = new Map()
person.set('name', 'Artur')
person.set('surname', 'Fedorov')

/**
 * @type {number}
 */
const num = person // will error
```

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Artur',
  surname: 'Fedorov'
}

/**
 * @type {number}
 */
const num = person // will error
```

```js
const person = function() {}
/**
 * @type {number}
 */
const num = person // will error
```

ðŸ˜ž GCC cannot infer the type of array.

```js
const x = [1,2,3,4]
x.push('xxx') // ðŸ˜ž does not error, but it should!
```

## Return value - simple
ðŸ˜ž GCC cannot infer not even a very simple return value.

**This means you have to always annotate return types! ALWAYS.**

```js
const runme = () => {
  return 'hello'
}

/**
 * @type {number}
 */
const x = runme() // ðŸ˜ž does not error but it should! Vscode and TS are smarter

console.info('x', x)
```

```js
const x = (function() {
  const x = 1
  const y = 2
  return x + y
})()

/**
 * @type {string}
 */
const y = x // ðŸ˜ž does not error but it should! Vscode and TS are smarter
```

## Being defined

âœ… GC can infer that a variable inside a non-null check is not null.

```js
/**
 * @type {string|null}
 */
const x = 'hello'

if (x != null) {
  /**
   * @type {string}
   */
  const y = x // does not error
}
```

âœ… GC can infer that a variable with defensive non-null check is not null.

```js
function hello() {
  /**
   * @type {string|null}
   */
  const x = 'hello'

  if (x == null) {
    return null
  }

  /**
   * @type {string}
   */
  const y = x // does not error
}
```

```js
function hello() {
  /**
   * @type {string|null}
   */
  const x = 'hello'

  if (x == null) {
    throw new Error('fail')
  }

  /**
   * @type {string}
   */
  const y = x // does not error
}
```

ðŸ˜ž However, if there are **two** defensive non-null checks, that is already too much for GCC. It cannot infer that vars are non-null in that case.

```js
/**
 * @returns {{canvas: HTMLCanvasElement, renderingContext: CanvasRenderingContext2D }}
 */
function init() {
  const canvas = /** @type {!HTMLCanvasElement|null} */ (document.getElementById('canvas'))
    
  if (!canvas) {
    throw new Error('canvas not found')
  }

  const renderingContext = canvas.getContext('2d')

  if (!renderingContext) {
    throw new Error('rendering context not ready, canvas is not usable')
  }

  return { //ðŸ˜ž errors even though it should not, thinks vars can be null even though they definitely cannot
    canvas,
    renderingContext,
  }
}
```

ðŸ˜ž Sadly even simple null checks are not enough if the function is slightly longer.

```js
_getContext() {
  const renderingContext = this.canvas.getContext('2d')

  if (!renderingContext) {
    throw new Error('rendering context not ready, canvas is not usable')
  }

  renderingContext.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height)
  
  return  /** @type {CanvasRenderingContext2D} */ (renderingContext) // ðŸ˜ž GCC should know this is not null, but doesn't.
}
```

## Enums

ðŸ˜ž Enums can be edited, GCC does not detect that. Luckily that is not a big problem, because GCC uses only the original declaration for type checking, so even if you add values to enum, you cannot use them in compile time.

```js
/**
 * @enum {string}
 */
const Fruit = {
  APPLE: 'APPLE',
  ORANGE: 'ORANGE',
  BANANA: 'BANANA',
}

Fruit.MOVIE = 'Game of Thrones' // ðŸ˜ž enum can be edited, but it should not. Vscode / TS would error, GCC does not

/**
 * @param {Fruit} fruit
 */
function eat(fruit) {}

eat(Fruit.MOVIE) // will error and that is good. even though .MOVIE was added to enum, GCC check types with respect to original declaration only
```

## Object union types
ðŸ˜ž GCC will not infer type of object based on its attributes. This would come useful if you have documents of different interface in one collection.

```js
/**
 * @typedef {{ seeds: number }}
 */
var AppleType;

/**
 * @typedef {{ juice: string }}
 */
var OrangeType;

/**
 * @type {AppleType | OrangeType}
 */
const fruit = {
  seeds: 5,
}

if ('seeds' in fruit) {
  console.log('Juice ', fruit.juice); // ðŸ˜ž will not error. TS will error
}
```

## Sets and Maps

ðŸ˜ž GCC will not infer type of values in the set
```js
const set = new Set([1, 2])

set.has('hello') // ðŸ˜ž will not error, but should
```

## Class attributes

ðŸ˜ž **Untyped attributes** become `?` type (unsafe any type). So make sure you always type your attributes. Typescript would simply infer that it is number. [Documented here.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System#differences-between-inferred-and-declared-types)

```js
class Car {
  constructor(){
    this.age = 20 // becomes `?` type
  }
}
```
