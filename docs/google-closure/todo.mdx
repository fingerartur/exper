## Notes
- how does GCC handle cyclic dependencies? No they can be created, GCC does not error. I have not found a GCC option for preventing them. And authors [do not care](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/1883)
- Problem is GC works with types one way whereas the type warning that I see in IDE are vscode JSDoc based warnings, which may be stronger or weaker than GC. So it is possible I am annotation types needlessly because GC can infer them but vscode cannot. It would be nice to find out the inferring strength of each and compare.
- there is a webpack plugin https://www.npmjs.com/package/closure-webpack-plugin

- somehow HTMLElement and Element get confused, it looks like GCC almost redefines types for DOM API, it is very weird
```js
/**
 * @type {HTMLElement|null}
 */
const el = document.getElementById('hello') // vscode does not error, but GCC does! (and it shouldn't is my opinion)

// ./src/js/index.js:34:11: WARNING - [JSC_TYPE_MISMATCH] initializing variable
// found   : (Element|null)
// required: (HTMLElement|null)
//   34| const el = document.getElementById('hello')
```

# TODO GC

1. Read whole wiki
2. Read Discuss
3. Does GCC keep typedefs and inferfaces in the bundle during advanced compilation?
4. Is there any way to get Type Utils such as ReturnValue etc.?
5. How to create a library - does it work with ESM,CJS,UMD,AMD?
6. how to polyfill and transpile to ES5?
7. here is a list of all disabled warnings, some of them should be enabled https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Warnings
8. does dead code elimination work?
9. Make warnings stricter https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ#when-using-type-checking-sometimes-closure-compiler-doesnt-warn-me-about-missing-properties-why-not


## TODO extra

1. interop with TS libraries? does GCC check types according to ts libraries?
2. memory leak 1 https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/2689
3. Study shaka player
