# Strange, wrong and bugged types 
There are many problems and bugs. Here is a list.


## Record type syntax is strange
Syntax of `@typedef` is [strange](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Annotating-JavaScript-for-the-Closure-Compiler#typedef-type)
```js
/** 
 * @typedef {{
 *            foo:string,
 *            bar:number,
 *            foobar: (number|string)
 *          }}
 */
var Mytype;
```

## Record Types allow access to undeclared attributes
Record types allow access to undeclared attributes

```js
/**
 * @type {{ name: string }}
 */
const x = {
  name: 'hello',
}

x.surname = 'xxxx'
```

*This cannot be fixed with @struct, only with strictMissingProperties flag.*

## 2D array syntax sucks
2D arrays `T[][]` are not supported, you must use ```Array<Array<T>>``` instead

## No literal types
GC does not have string/number literal type, such as:

```js
/**
 * @type {'apple'} // Produces error, unsupported type
 */
const fruit = 'apple'
```

This leads to a bigger problem, that I cannot use label-based conditions on POJOs, which is a common thing to do in Typescript. Actually you can do it here, but only via type casting.

```js
/**
 * @param {{ type: 'orange', height: number } | { type: 'apple', age: number }} fruit
*/
function eat(fruit) {
  if (fruit.type === 'apple') {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Generic object type fails
Generic Objects (e.g. `Object<string, number>`) [do not work](../report)

## typeof is useless
`typeof` operator does not work as expected. [Apparently you can only use it on a namespace and I do not even know what that means.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System)

## Some, and only some, types are nullable
**Some type are nullable by default.** This is a fucking joke. More specifically, primitive types are non-nullable and Object-based types are nullable. Let's see examples:

Primitive types are not nullable or undefinable
```js
/**
 * @type {number} // string, boolean
 */
const x = null // produces error
const x = undefined // produces error
```

Object-based types are nullable (but not undefinable)
```js
class Car {}
/**
 * @type {Car} // String, Boolean, Object, Array, Promise, Function, Symbol, Set, Map, Node, Element
 */
const x = null
const x = undefined // produces error
```

**As a result, you should use a ridiculous amount of `!` in your code all the time!**

```js
class Car {}
/**
  * @type {!Car} // ! specifies that type is non-nullable
  */
const x = new Car()
const x = null // produces error
```

**Record types are not nullable**, which is a good thing.
  
*Even though it may be confusing, because they literally describe and object and its attributes.*

```js
/**
 * @typedef {{
 *  id: string,
 *  name: string
 * }}
 */
var Car;

/**
 * @type {Car}
 */
const car = null; // produces error
```

## Array/Collection type-check sucks
- Arrays are [wrongly assumed to never be empty](../report)
- HTML collection is [wrongly assumed to never be empty](../report)

## Arrays have some problems with type checking
Array literals are not type checked!

```js
// GCC does not know this is array of number
[-1,0,1,2,3,4]
```

`Array.reduce` is not type checked at all.


## DOM type check sucks
In short DOM type checking only starts to work correctly when `strictCheckTypes` compiler flag is enabled. Then is is pretty fine, not perfect, but fine.

[Read more all the details.](./dom)

## Map type-check sucks
`Map.get()` is wrongly assumed to [never return undefined](../report)

## Array type-check sucks
`Array.pop()` and `Array.shift()` is wrongly assumed to [never return undefined](../report)

## Array type-check sucks on generics
`Array<string|number>` can be assigned to `Array<string>`. This is obviously very wrong. [They make up excuses on why they allowed it.](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Typechecking-Pitfalls)

## Unions are a mess
Union types are a [big mess](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System#union-types). Basically they work same as set union, so instead of representing a multiple different types like in Typescript, the union type represents a single new type that has all the properties of the sub-types on it.

**Union types therefore allow many invalid things to happen.** As a rule of thumb, always cast your values to a specific type first and them work with them.

```js
/**
 * @type {string|number}
*/
let text1 = 555
const len = text1.length 

/**
 * @type {string|Array<string>}
*/
let arg = 'hello'
arg.filter(Boolean)
```

As an added bonus to add to all the mess, [union types sometimes convert attributes to unknown (?)](.report) type. As in this example:

```js
/**
 * @typedef {{ name: string} | {age: number, name: string}}
 */
var Car;

/**
 * @type {Car}
 */
const car = { name: 'BMW'}
car.age.toUpperCase() // should error, because car.age is a number
```

## No arrow function types allowed
Arrow function types are not supported, to type a callback use `function` syntax

```js
/**
 * Supported:
* @type {function(string): string}
*/
let pasteText = text => text

/**
 * Not supported:
* @type {string => string}
* @type {(x: string) => string}
*/
```

## No union of callbacks or function overloading types allowed
Union of callback types is not supported. This means that **function/method overloading is not supported** either.

```js
/**
 * @type {function(string): string|function(number): number} // is equivalent to @type {function(?): ?}
*/
let cutText = function(text) {
  return text
}

/**
 * @type {number}
*/
const value = cutText(new Date()) // No error is produced neither left nor right
```

### Promises are not type-checked well
[Read about it here](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4040)

```js
/**
 * @type {Promise<string>}
 */
const p = Promise.resolve() // should raise error, it resolves to undefined, not string
```

```js
/**
 * @type {Promise<string>}
 */
const p = Promise.resolve().then(function() { return 555 }) // should raise error, it resolves to number, not string
```

```js
/**
 * @type {Promise<string>}
 */
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(666) // should raise error, it resolves to number, not string
})
```

```js
/**
 * @type {Promise<number>} // should raise error, it resolves to string, not number
 */
const p = new Promise(
  /**
   * @param {function(string): void} resolve 
   * @param {function(string): void} reject 
   */
  (resolve, reject) => {
    resolve('Hello')
  }
)
```

## Typedefs fail with recursion without warning
Typedefs (or *record types*) do not support recursion but instead of error, the recursive attribute [just gets converted to `?` type](../report).

## Visibility checks fail
Class methods and attributes can be marked `@private`, `@protected`, but works a bit strange. In addition to working as expected, the private/protected attributes and methods can also be **accessed anywhere within the file where the class is defined.**

```js
export class Car {
  constructor() {
    /**
     * @private
     */
    this.color = 'red';
  }
}

const car = new Car().color = 'blue' // ok. It is in the same file
```

## Spread/rest operators work only half the time
[Object spread](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/3132) and [object rest](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4042) operators do not get type-checked correctly.

**Luckily at least rest params and array rest are type checked as they should.**
```js
/**
 * @param {...number} args 
 */
function sum(...args) {
  return args
}
```
```js
/**
 * @type {Array<number>}
 */
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
const [x, ...rest] = [1,2,3,4,5,6] // GCC understands that `rest` is Array<number>
```
