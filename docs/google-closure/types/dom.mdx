# DOM type checking
Default type checking of HTML elements is a joke, but with `strictCheckTypes` it's pretty fine. Let's break it down:

## Lack of documentation
The only documented types are `Element` and `Node`.

Luckily, there are also other types available: `HTMLElement`, `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, etc. ([missing doc reported](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/4036))

**Sadly, the list is incomplete, so types for `HTMLCanvasElement`, `HTMLVideoElement` and probably others are missing.**

Check the source code of DOM and of browser APIs in general.

- [DOM2 source code](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/externs/browser/w3c_dom2.js)
- [DOM for HTML5](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/externs/browser/html5.js)
- [Browser APIs source code](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/tree/master/externs/browser) including other versions of DOM.


## Default behavior
By default `Element` represents all HTML elements at once and it works like this:

1. Basic attributes that are any HTML element has (such as `id`, `textContent`, `style`) are type-checked as expected.

```js
  const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0]
  const x = div?.id // `id` is string
```

2. Advanced attributes that only some elements have are type-checked, but their type is **unknown**. **So it is a very shitty level of type checking.**

```js
const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0]
const ctx = div.getContext("2d") // `ctx` is unknown
div.width = { width: 400 } // `width` is unknown, so I can pass anything to it, this is wrong
div.height = 100 // `height` is unknown
``` 

3. Attributes that do not exist on any DOM element produce error

```js
const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0]
const ctx = div.getContextzzzz("2d") // produces error
``` 

## Strict behavior
It is definitely a good idea to enable strict type checking `strictCheckTypes`, because then finally the DOM types start to be checked correctly (same as in Typescript).

## How to define missing DOM types
If you want to work with `Canvas` with strict mode, you will have to improve its type.

To do this correctly, it must be done via **externs**. Here is a possible way to define externs for DOM types:


```js
/**
 * @fileoverview Advanced DOM types
 * @externs
 */

/**
 * @typedef {{
*    clearRect: Function,
* }}
*/
var RenderingContext2D;

/**
 * @extends {HTMLCanvasElement}
 */
class HTMLCanvasElement2 {
  constructor() {
    /**
     * @type {function(string): (RenderingContext2D | null)})}
     */
    this.getContext;
  }
}
```

## Confusion in Vscode IDE

If you are using vscode IDE, intellisense will show you rich types from Typescript. This cool feature is build-in to vscode.

**However, these are Typescript types, not GCC types. So don't be fooled!**

```js
// vscode tells me this is HTMLCollectionOf<HTMLDivElement>, however GCC tell me it is `NodeList<Element>`
const div = document.getElementsByTagName("div")
// vscode tells me this is `HTMLElement | null`, however GCC tells me this is in fact `Element` type
const div = document.getElementById("div")
```

### IDE problem
The fact that GC and Typescript have completely different DOM types is a big deal. This means any time I work with DOM elements vscode will show me warnings/errors in IDE, because the GCC types are differently names, or may not even exist. That sucks tremendously.

This GC / Typescript mismatch is not limited to DOM types, but there it is the most painful.

*You can work around this with `@ts-ignore`. It is very strange to use ts-ignore in GC code, but you can do it.*

```js
// @ts-ignore
width: this.canvas.width,
```

**My opinion: If you cannot comfortably use a language in Vscode, it is a BIG problem.**
