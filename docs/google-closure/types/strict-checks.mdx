# About `strictCheckTypes` compiler flag
This flag is mentioned several times in the doc. I ran a quick analysis to find out if I want to enable it or not. **The answer is yes!**

Let's have a look at what the flag does:

```js
// Object gets changed, now it has only basic attributes
/**
 * @param {Object} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.getContext('2d') // produces error
}

// Element gets changed, now it has only basic attributes
/**
 * @param {Element} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.style // ok
}

// ? type stays the same
/**
 * @param {?} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.getContext('2d') // ok
}

// * type changes, now it does not match any type instead of matching all.
// Now you always have to type-cast it before continuing
/**
 * @param {*} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.filter() // produces error
}

// Old-style classes become @struct (so you cannot access undefined attributes anymore)
/**
 * @constructor
 */
function Car() {}
new Car().color = 'blue' // produces error

// Record types "become @struct"
/**
 * @type {{ name: string }}
 */
const x = {
  name: 'hello',
}
x.surname = 'xxxx' // produces error

// Union types completely change. From representing a set union of given types, they now represent a set intersection. So only attributes that are common in all give types are accessible, nothing else.
/**
 * @typedef {{ name: string} | {age: number, name: string}}
 */
var Car;
/**
 * @type {Car}
 */
const car = { name: 'BMW'}
const age = car.age // produces error. Previously it would work.
```

## Good
1. It makes old-style classes `@struct`.
2. It makes record types `@struct-like`
3. It makes DOM `Element` type truthful
4. It makes union types truthful (you cannot access an attribute unless you type cast on a single type)

## Bad
1. `Object` type is now useless. However, the good news is that `Object` type sucks whether `strictCheckTypes` is on or off, **don't use it**.

## Problem with missing browser types
There is a big, problem with `strictCheckTypes` and that is when DOM/browser types are wrong or missing. What to do then? It is the fault of authors of GCC but I am the one who has to deal with it.

The "easy" solution is to suppress the warnings.

```js
/**
 * @suppress {strictMissingProperties} `globalThis.onmessage` type missing in GCC
 */
globalThis.onmessage = (_event) => {
  /**
   * @suppress {reportUnknownTypes} for `_event`
   */
  const event = /** @type {MessageEvent} */ (_event);

  if (!event.data) {
    return
  }
  
  // ...
}
```

A more sophisticated solution would be to [define my own **externs** for DOM/browser APIs](./dom#how-to-define-missing-dom-types).
