# About `strictCheckTypes` compiler flag
This flag is mentioned several times in the doc. I ran a quick analysis to find out if I want to enable it or not. The answer is not.

Let's have a look at what the flag does:

```js
// Object gets changed, now it has only basic attributes
/**
 * @param {Object} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.getContext('2d') // produces error
}

// Element gets changed, now it has only basic attributes
/**
 * @param {Element} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.style // ok
}

// ? type stays the same
/**
 * @param {?} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.getContext('2d') // ok
}

// * type changes, now it does not match any type instead of matching all.
// Now you always have to type-cast it before continuing
/**
 * @param {*} x 
 */
function go(x) {
  return x.filter() // produces error
}

// Old-style classes become @struct (so you cannot access undefined attributes anymore)
/**
 * @constructor
 */
function Car() {}
new Car().color = 'blue' // produces error

// Record types "become @struct"
/**
 * @type {{ name: string }}
 */
const x = {
  name: 'hello',
}
x.surname = 'xxxx' // produces error

// Union types completely change. From representing a set union of given types, they now represent a set intersection. So only attributes that are common in all give types are accessible, nothing else.
/**
 * @typedef {{ name: string} | {age: number, name: string}}
 */
var Car;
/**
 * @type {Car}
 */
const car = { name: 'BMW'}
const age = car.age // produces error. Previously it would work.
```

## Good
1. It makes old-style classes `@struct`.
2. It makes record types `@struct-like`

## Bad
1. I cannot work with DOM elements anymore. Having unchecked `Element` type was bad, but at least I could access its attributes, now I cannot.
2. `Object` type is now useless, same story as with `Element`.
3. Union types are now upside down. Instead of representing a set union they now represent set intersection.

## Conclusion
`Object` type sucks whether `strictCheckTypes` is on or off, don't use it.

The strict check is great but there is simply no [reasonable way to make it work with the DOM](./report). So my advice is to enable it if you are not working with the DOM, otherwise keep it disabled.
