# Type system
In essence GC type system is similar to Typescript. Let's now have a look at some note-worthy and strange things.

## Noteworthy
[Here are some interesting point on how the type system behaves and about its syntax](./notable-types). It covers optional types and params, error suppression, any/all types, recursion, read-only, interfaces, try/catch. There are also topics such as default nullability, non-strictness on implicit types, etc.

## Strange and wrong
[Many things about the type system are strange, some are wrong, some are wrong by design and some are simply bugs.](./wrong) In any case it is useful to be aware of all these pitfalls.

In my opinion the number of bugs is way too high. I would not consider GCC a serious type system. These are not just corner cases.

### Lack of Type Utilities
Sadly the type system lacks Type Utilities (such as `ReturnType`, `Omit`, etc. see [TS type utilities](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)). This leads to a lot more boilerplate.

### Externs do not support ES6
Externs do not support ES6 class syntax!





## Compiler flags
The strictness of the compiler can be configured and by default it is not as strict as it could be. Sadly the [compiler flags are a big mess and frequently do not work](./warnings-config).

**I recommend enabling:**

```bash
--jscomp_error=checkDebuggerStatement \
--jscomp_error=unusedLocalVariables \
--jscomp_error=reportUnknownTypes \
--jscomp_error=strictCheckTypes
```

### Strict type checking
There are two flags vital to making sure type checking is strict and on point:

1. `strictCheckTypes` - [makes sure you can only access the attributes that are definitely defined on a type](./strict-checks). Also, union types become intersection types.
2. `reportUnknownTypes` - whenever GCC does not know the type it produces a warning (by default there is no warning)
