# Compiler flags
Type compiler does not checks all the types that it could. Some type checks are simply disabled by default. Let's have a look at them and see what I can use in my advantage.

[The list is here](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Warnings). I looked at the ones that are OFF to see if I should turn them ON.

**Sadly and ironically, most of them don't work or have something wrong with them.**

1. `checkDebuggerStatement` âœ…
2. `unusedLocalVariables` âœ…
3. `reportUnknownTypes` âœ…
4. `visibility`, `accessControls` -ðŸš¨ TODO both are ON by default. Fix doc
5. `const` (includes `constantProperty`) - ðŸš¨ TODO is ON by default, both are. Fix doc
6. `missingRequire` - works by default on ESM modules
7. `missingReturn` ðŸš¨ does nothing - TODO report
8. `strictCheckTypes`
   - includes `strictMissingProperties` âœ…
   - includes `strictPrimitiveOperators` ðŸš¨ does nothing - TODO report
9.  `unusedPrivateMembers` ðŸš¨ does nothing - TODO report
10. `missingProperties` ðŸš¨ - do not know what it means
11. `strictModuleDepCheck` ðŸš¨ - do not know what it means
12. `typeInvalidation` ðŸš¨ - do not know what it means
13. `undefinedNames` ðŸš¨ - UKNOWN to compiler

### missingReturn
```js
function hello() {
  let x = 555
  return 'hello' // should error
}
```

### unusedPrivateMembers
```js
class Car {
  constructor() {
    /**
     * @private
     */
    this.color = 'red'; // should error
  }
}
```

### strictCheckTypes / strictPrimitiveOperators
```js
function go() {
  return 555 + 'hello' + {} + new Element() // should error
}
```

### reportUnknownTypes

Actually the documentation is wrong. it says *Warnings for any place in the code where type is inferred to ?. NOT RECOMMENDED!* But if you declare ?, it also fails (this is not inferred, it is declared).
```js
/**
 * @param {?} z // produces error. Problem here is that now I cannot use ? type at all it is just not possible and that sucks, so I cannot use both flags at the same time even though I would like to.
 * 
 * Because reportUnknownTypes can tell me that I forgot to type a param or return value etc.
 */
function hello(z) {
  console.log('hello', z);
}
```

Also a good question: why is it `NOT RECOMMENDED!`?
