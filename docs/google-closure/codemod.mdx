# Trying to convert GC code to JSDOC TS code
1. [JSDOC TS 1](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-checking-javascript-files.html)
2. [JSDOC TS 2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html#unsupported-tags)
JSDOC TS type system is stronger and in general a superset of GCC types system.

## Idea
Convert GCC code to JSDOC TS and use webpack + ts-loader to build it. Enjoy much better type checking, IDE support (live), less code, more typed libraries, auto generated types. On the webpack side enjoy a world of plugins.

If you need hardcore minification, use GCC as a webpack plugin to minify the code. Be careful however about **externs** (for server calls, web worker, exported/imported lib API).

## Problems with syntax:
1. **If GC project is not in strict mode**, union types, Element type, HTMLElement type, any type work very differently from TS behavior. Also parts of code may be untyped, that is allowed. This would make conversion very difficult.
2. Another problem is that all types are nullable by default such as `Array` and non-nullables are written with an exclamation mark `!Array`
3. Another problem: `generic types`, `interfaces`, `typedefs`, `enums` these have a wildly different syntax from TS
4. If the project uses GCC old module syntax (`goog.provide`, `goog.require`) this would be difficult to transform into import / export. It would have to be done manually file by file. Because this syntax basically works with global namespaces.
5. If the project uses GCC new module syntax (`goog.module`, `goog.require`) this is similar to ESM so this could be relatively easy to convert into ESM, if there is a code-mod for that!

## Plan of action
1. Use a codemod (e.g. [this from Google](https://github.com/angular/clutz#gents---closure-to-typescript-converter)) to convert import statements to ESM
2. Switch out webpack + TS for GCC, the code will produce 1000s of errors, especially if it was not in strict mode, make an error snapshot.
3. Analyze bundle size, if it is much larger, use more hard-core minification (e.g. GCC as webpack plugin). This might be difficult to set up (with externs).
4. Gradually fix files and convert JS to TS files. This is possible. Always run a new error snapshot and diff. Commit only when the diff has less errors.
5. Finally when error snapshot is empty, your work here is done.
