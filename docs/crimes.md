# Crimes against humanity

Observe a few funny things:

1. Every crisis is an opportunity of people in power. War is an opportunity to sell weapons at a high price. Covid 19 is an opportunity to sell vaccines and masks at a high price. During Russian war EU and USA stopped buying petrol and gas from Russia to weaken it's economy, but Hungarian corrupt president Victor Orban kept buying at a lower price and made billions and he has not been punished yet, by anybody.
2. During war there are no rules. Even though there are rules for war, forbidden weapon, poisons, nuclear weapons, when countries are at war they immediately break all these rules. Especially Russia loves breaking them, they use forbidden weapons, they mass murder civilians, they use nuclear powerplants as a shield and attack from there. They promise they will not attack a shipment of grain and then they do. They stop all shipments of electricity and gas even though you have paid for it and they signed a contract. They lie every day on TV. You cannot trust either side. Only a neutral third party may know the truth but they are too detached so they can only speculate.
3. You can spot a dictator by how fast he starts killing is own people. During the war Putin's killers kill each week one of his council or some very rich CEOs. The motives are not known, but you can guess pretty easily, either they disobeyed him or he wants to take over their companies and money, likely both. The cool thing about Putin's assassins is that they always make it look like a suicide and the police literally cannot do anything about it. The police has always said so far that it was a suicide. But guess what even if they has proof, how will they ever arrest Putin? There is no international police.
4. If people are taught something by their parents and community from young age, they will believe it so much they are willing to die for it. This is why Christian vs. Muslim conflicts are so bloody, this is why Muslims are capable of suicide bombing. And even if you forget about wars, think about the [FLDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-Day_Saints) church operating in the USA still today, where it is basically one big polygamist pedophilic community and the young girls believe that what is happening to them is normal.

## Ongoing long
- [South Korea concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_North_Korea) any religion is prosecuted, because the only religion is the on where Kim Jon Un is god. If you are religious or  disagree with the regime, you and 3 generations of your family go to concentration camp. It is basically forced labour, some torture and rape. But 40% of people die there from starvation.

## 2023


## 2022
- **Russian invasion of Ukraine**. Mass murder, rape, destroying power plants, invading nuclear power plants and taking over multiple times, war zone around power plant, making **nuclear threats to the whole world**, Putin does not pay his soldiers and deserters are shot. On both sides civilians are recruited, but in Russia only a few percent of the population. Drastic cyber attacks. The war continued until 2023. As a result of sanctions European gas, petrol and electricity prices doubled, maybe tripled, this also caused inflation on all other products (cca 20% in CR). European governments are also using a lot of tax money to send ammo to Ukraine, in total I am paying with cca 30% of my income for the war every day.
- **Iran girls** are protesting against the regime and for their rights. They show their hair and for that they go to prison, and many are instantly beaten to death by so called religious police. The protests are still continuing, but hundreds of thousands of protesters, mostly women are sentenced to death. Obviously they are raped as well even though it is not documented [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaths_during_the_Mahsa_Amini_protests)

## 2021
- **Taliban victory in Afghanistan**, because USA troops left. Taliban killed all anti-taliban Afghans, mass murder, women forbidden to educate themselves etc., tens of people were trying to escape so desperately that they sat on top of a plane and inevitably fell to their death [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021))
- **Myanmar** military takeover [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_Myanmar_civil_war)

## 2020
- **COVID 19** an artificial virus designed to spread and infect as easily as possible leaked from Chinese lab, the research was financed by USA. It reached Europe in Feb 2020, nobody new how to fight it, governments panicked and reacted retroactively. All politicians lied about it's origin. Many politicians used this to enrich themselves selling vaccines, masks, closing down competition etc. They managed to make it political. Nobody went to prison. Millions of mostly old people died. Vaccines were mostly safe but killed tens of people. Lock-downs caused a light economic crisis in 2022, people lost cca 20-30% of their savings due to inflation caused by Covid and Ukrainian war. Covid continued until 2023. Since I worked during COVID19, and cca 50% of people did not. I paid for their salaries with my taxes and will keep on paying for many years to come because the government took a loan. [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEh5JyZC218&t=3056s)

## 2019

## 2017
- Syria, Afghanistan, (Mexico) [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_conflicts_in_2017)
- [Uygur concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps) in China. Uygurs are an ethnic Turkic Muslim group in China. Obviously this makes them different so that automatically leads to conflict on both sides. They fought for independence and even organized a few terrorist attacks on normal Chinese. Chinese government overreacted to the last attack and started building concentration camps and sending Uyghurs there. They have forced labor, some torture and rape, but it seems (hopefully) that at least they are not extermination camps like the ones used by Nazis. 3 million Uyghurs have been forced into these camps and it is still going on today without any response from international community. Ironically, Muslim countries look away, because they have good business relationship with China, so only Christian countries are talking about it, but not doing anything. Except for the cams, Chinese are also force-sterilizing the rest of the Uygur population and trying to convert them to atheist.

## 2016
Syria, Afghanistan, (Mexico) [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_conflicts_in_2016)

## 2015
Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria. Boko Haram is a Nigerian group of Islamists that are killing the Christian majority, because of religion, basically what has been happening in Europe 500 years agon. Sadly they use suicide bombing. [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_conflicts_in_2015)

## 2014
- **Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan**. In Sudan Africa, there is a civil war. The [south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan) of the country split in 2011 and since then there is a crazy ongoing civil war. [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_conflicts_in_2014)
- **[Crimea stolen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)** - Putin simply marched with Russian army to Ukraine and took Crimea, it became part of Russia and nobody from the international community did anything about it. Crimea is a very rich, strategic island in Ukraine. There are the largest ports etc. An incredible amount of money will come to Russia thanks to this move. The funny thing here is that after the Russia promised not only never to invade Ukraine but also to protect it in exchange for their nuclear weapons when USSR fell. This is called [Budapest memorandum](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-forgotten-security-guarantee-the-budapest-memorandum/a-18111097). Obviously taking Crimea breaks this promise, and guess what they will break it even more in the year 2022.

## 2013
Egypt's first democratically elected president was elected. However he was Muslim and immediately he started passing muslim laws, [people did not like that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Egyptian_revolution). People protested, military took over the government, and [over 1000 people were killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) in the center of Cairo during the protest.

## 1997
[**Kurd massacre by Turkey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict_(1978%E2%80%93present)) Kurds are a curious nation of people how have their own language and culture, but not a state. They live in a [territory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Kurdish-inhabited_area_by_CIA_%281992%29_box_inset_removed.jpg) overlapping Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq so not a good location. I don't know about the other countries, but Turkey is trying to wipe them out and they in turn want autonomy. The conflict is ongoing till today (2022), but it was bloodiest in 1997.
