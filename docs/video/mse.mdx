# MSE
[Media source extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API) allows more fine-grained control of creating media (audio/video) streams and playing them, as opposed to just passing a URI to video/audio element.

I am in charge of downloading the video file binary. I can download a large file in chunks, I can switch between qualities (switch between two binary files), etc.

## Caveats
- MSE does not accept classic MP4 files, the MP4 files must be specially formatted! [MP4 files must be segmented.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API/Transcoding_assets_for_MSE) With regards to MPEG-DASH and HLS, I assume they are always segmented.


## Media source
[`MediaSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSource) represents one video

**Notable methods:** `addSourceBuffer`, `removeSourceBuffer`, `endOfStream`

**Notable events:** `sourceclose`, `sourceopen`, `sourceended`

### Caveats
- Media source can have multiple source buffers, and this is confusing. [It seems that a `MediaSource` can have max two active `SourceBuffer`s - one video and one audio.](https://web.dev/media-mse-basics/). However it is just hinted at, I have not found clear documentation on it. **(undocumented)**

## Source Buffer
[`SourceBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SourceBuffer) represents binary data of one video.

When creating `SourceBuffer` I must specify the MIME type very much in detail, e.g. mime `video/mp4; codecs="avc1.640020, mp4a.40.2"`. Because the specification is vague, some browsers support the simple `video/mp4` MIME, but others do not, so to have compatibility, it must be specific as hell.

**Notable methods:** `appendBuffer()` (must wait until `updateend` / until `updating` of previous buffer is `false`), `remove` a buffered time range

**Notable events:** `updatestart`, `updateend`, `error`

### Tools that reveal MIME
1. Good CLI tool `npx get-video-mime video.mp4`
2. [Good online tool is here ](https://nickdesaulniers.github.io/mp4info/)


### Caveats
- When I append binary chunks of video to `SourceBuffer`, I can append chunks of any size (100 B, 1000 B, ...) I don't need to parse the MP4 in order to parse out its logical segments, no - just chunk it into any pieces I want and feed it in via `appendBuffer()`. **(undocumented)**
- While not all pieces have been fed in, the video element does not know the duration of the video, therefore duration UI and progress UI is wrong. This can be fixed by manually setting `MediaSource.duration = 10`.

## Video stitching
It is possible to take and stitch together multiple video files in javascript by feeding them one by one into `SourceBuffer.appendBuffer()` and for each new video file calling `SourceBuffer.changeType(newMime)` and `SourceBuffer.timestampOffset = (duration of previous video(s) in seconds)`.

## What video formats/codecs are supported by MSE?
Even though MSE is standardized, there is **no compulsory support** for formats / codecs in the standard. Somebody made [this list of support across browsers](https://cconcolato.github.io/media-mime-support/).

## Web worker
[MSE works in web worker (since Chrome 108 is beta as of October 27, 2022)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API#availability_in_workers)

## Bugs
1. Sometimes when I stitch videos, progress bar shows buffered only the first video and only it plus a bit of the second plays, then the player stops at buffering and never continues. In the console there are no errors. This seems to be a bug of MSE!

## To Report
1. The fact that MSE consumes only specific formatted files (e.g. only a subset of MP4) is not obvious and not well documented at least not on MDN. [I am not the first one to complain about this.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42234078/html5-mediasource-works-with-some-mp4-files-and-not-with-others-same-codecs)


## TODO
- TODO why MediaSource accepts multiple buffers, what is this useful for and how does this work? [Actually here is some stackoverflow about how it does not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30436099/smooth-representation-change-using-media-source-api). Todo investigate independently
- TODO what is MediaSource.activeSourceBuffers? Are there some inactive buffers? Can I have multiple buffers shifted by offset in seconds?
